## CAUTION

* The application is still in development stage so some parts may be buggy.
* It takes some time to post a program and edit a program please wait for the confirmation message
* Sometimes due to internal errors the user automatically logs out 
* Even after the confirmation alert, if the page doesn't update do refresh the page manually
